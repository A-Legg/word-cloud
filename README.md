## Project to create a word_cloud 'warmup'
### Goals
1. Use the faker gem to create sample data to work on hashes and arrays.
1. Learn how to read and write data into a JSON file.
1. Write tests to create scenarios that a person has to figure out how to solve.
1. Get creative to help *me* learn and hopefully help others.

### To create the data/names_and_bs.json file of fake names and bs

Edit fake_data_creator.rb to the number of names and saying you want.
 - line 7 is for names
 - line 10 is for the number of sayings

### Below is the start of the instructions for the "real" README warmup


## Blah Blah!

You really care about sounding like a pompous, ostentatious fool. You found a cool site that lists the cool people and the cool things they say.

So, cool, all you have to do is make sure you are always saying the same cool things people will think you are, well, cool. Easy? Or not!

Holy bat-mobile Batman! The information is stored in a JSON file. If only you had paid more attention in week 7 of your 6 month, intensive, full-stack Ruby and Rails programming class held in beautiful downtown Boulder Colorado and knew your arrays from your hashes and knew who the heck this Jason guy was/is!

Oh well, better late than never. There is hope. Make the tests pass . . . perhaps you will find the enlightenment you desire.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
1. Look at the data in `names_and_bs.json`
1. Make the tests pass.
1. SILENTLY showoff to your friends how crazy smart you are!
